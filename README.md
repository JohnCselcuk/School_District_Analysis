## Overview of Analysis
This analysis created to get 15 diffrent high school results by following each cereteria:Student ID,student_name,gender,grade,	school_name,	reading_score,	math_score, type	size,	budget, average and percentage.After finding the results, we replace the data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact and perform the same analysis we did in our module. This data I have generated will have a big impact on how the schoolboard plans for the upcoming academic year.
