## Overview of Analysis
This analysis created to get 15 different high school results by following each criterion: Student ID, student name, gender, grade, school name, reading score, math score, type size, budget, average and percentage. After finding the results, we replace the data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact and perform the same analysis we did in our module. This data I have generated will have a big impact on how the schoolboard plans for the upcoming academic year.

## Results
- We used Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Python 3.7.6 to complete this analysis.
- We have converted the ".csv" files to a data frame.
- Next step we clean at least one dataset and checked missing or incorrect data and remove them
- We determine Data types to check if the numbers in these datasets are the correct data type for making analysis
- We have generated summaries for all high schools
- We have calculated High and low performance for each High school score, average, percentage etc...
- We have grouped each high school following by; Type, max.-min. score, students average, range per student, graduation level for each student etc...

Note: For more details please open '.ipynb' files link above, I have explained each code for this analysis
 


We have worked on large data sets and results will lead school border to get percations for next acedemic year. We made small changes and removing only a small portion of the data wich is math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School one of them. Please see picture below for Thomas High School original data set;

The table as shown in the below is the final results for 15 High Schools. Itâ€™s including all results that we analyze from data frame. This data frame and the results will change properly every year depends on the student success, budget and the percentage of the results.

## Summary
The four major changes that occurred is the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School.The removing unsucced students from data frame that will change total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis.This will tell us a change in average scores and score percentages. I can assume that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.

Thank you for your time
